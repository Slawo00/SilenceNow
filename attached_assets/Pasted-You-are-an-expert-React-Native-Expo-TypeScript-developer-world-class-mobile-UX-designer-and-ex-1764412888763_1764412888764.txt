You are an expert React Native + Expo + TypeScript developer, world-class mobile UX designer, and experienced CFO.

Context:
I already have a working finance transformation app built with Expo/React Native, called "SigmaFinanceAI" (working title). The app is a CFO coaching companion for optimizing the month-end close. It currently includes:

- Home screen with hero, key benefits, "How It Works", and "Optimization Goals"
- Onboarding flow (3 steps: primary goal, company size, close duration)
- Bottom tab navigation: Home, Goals, My Plan, AI Tools
- Goals screen: 4 goals (Speed, Quality & Accuracy, Automation, Compliance & Governance)
- Goal detail screens: show the chosen goal and its strategic levers
- Lever list screens: 10 levers per goal
- Lever detail screens: rich content (priority, effort/benefit, description, roles, KPIs, risks, examples, tech requirements, change management, recommended AI tools)
- AI Tools list screen with filters and basic tool cards
- My Plan screen with selected levers and a recommended starting goal banner
- Dark theme (as visible in the screenshots)

IMPORTANT CONSTRAINTS:
- Do NOT rebuild the app from scratch.
- Do NOT remove existing features.
- Only extend and refine the current implementation in a non-destructive way.
- Keep the current dark visual style and layout language.

I want you to critically improve the app in terms of UX, navigation, and data structure based on the following requirements.

========================================
X. PERSONALIZED RECOMMENDATIONS AFTER ONBOARDING
========================================

Please extend the existing onboarding and goals behavior:

1. AFTER ONBOARDING COMPLETION
- When the user finishes the 3 onboarding steps (primary goal, company size, close duration) and taps "Get Started":
  - Do NOT navigate back to a generic home screen.
  - Instead, immediately navigate to the GoalDetailScreen of the selected primary goal.
  - Example: if the user selected "Speed (Fast Close)", open that goal detail screen directly.

2. PERSONALIZED LEVER RANKING
- Each strategic lever already has:
  - priority (High/Medium/Low)
  - effort (Low/Moderate/High)
  - impact (Low/Moderate/High)
- Extend the lever data model with optional fit tags:
  - `recommendedCompanySizes?: ("small" | "mid" | "large")[]`
  - `recommendedCloseDurationRanges?: ("1-3" | "4-5" | "6-7" | "8-10" | "11-15" | "15+")[]`

- Implement a simple scoring function `getLeverScore(lever, onboardingResult)`:
  - basePriority: High = 3, Medium = 2, Low = 1
  - impactScore: High = 3, Medium = 2, Low = 1
  - effortBonus: Low = +2, Moderate = +1, High = 0
  - companyFitBonus: +2 if onboarding company size is included in `recommendedCompanySizes`, otherwise +0
  - closeDurationFitBonus: +2 if onboarding close duration is included in `recommendedCloseDurationRanges`, otherwise +0

  Example pseudo code:
  ```ts
  function getLeverScore(lever, onboarding) {
    const priorityMap = { High: 3, Medium: 2, Low: 1 };
    const impactMap = { High: 3, Medium: 2, Low: 1 };
    const effortBonusMap = { Low: 2, Moderate: 1, High: 0 };

    let score = 0;
    score += priorityMap[lever.priority];
    score += impactMap[lever.impact];
    score += effortBonusMap[lever.effort];

    if (lever.recommendedCompanySizes?.includes(onboarding.companySize)) {
      score += 2;
    }
    if (lever.recommendedCloseDurationRanges?.includes(onboarding.closeDurationRange)) {
      score += 2;
    }
    return score;
  }

•	On the GoalDetailScreen, when rendering the list of strategic levers:
	•	If onboarding is completed and we have an onboardingResult in state:
	•	Sort the levers by descending getLeverScore.
	•	At the top of the screen, above the lever list, show a small banner like:
	•	“Recommended order based on your situation”
	•	If onboarding is not completed, keep the original lever order.

	3.	HIGHLIGHT TOP RECOMMENDATIONS

	•	For the first 3 levers (highest score), add a small badge on the card:
	•	e.g. “Top recommendation” or “Quick win”
	•	Keep the compact two-line lever card layout we already defined (Priority / Effort / Impact on a single line like:
	•	Priority: [High]   Effort: [Moderate]   Impact: [High]

	4.	STATE HANDLING

	•	Store the onboarding result in a global context or a central hook so that:
	•	The GoalDetailScreen can always access onboardingResult.
	•	The My Plan screen can later use the same information (for future enhancements).

Make sure all of this is added on top of the existing implementation:
	•	Do NOT remove or break the current goal/lever navigation.
	•	Only extend the behavior with sorting and initial navigation after onboarding.



====================================================
1. CONSISTENT TOP HEADER WITH GLOBAL MENU
====================================================

Goal:
Ensure a consistent, branded header on ALL main and detail screens (except the onboarding wizard screens, which already have their own layout).

Requirements:

1. Create a reusable `AppHeader` component that:
   - Shows the SigmaFinanceAI logo or wordmark on the left.
   - Shows a hamburger menu icon on the right.
   - Accepts props:
     - `title?: string`
     - `showBackButton?: boolean`
     - `onBackPress?: () => void`
   - On detail screens (e.g., GoalDetail, LeverDetail) show a back arrow on the left, title in the center, and the hamburger on the right.

2. Use this `AppHeader` on:
   - Home tab
   - Goals tab
   - My Plan tab
   - AI Tools tab
   - Goal detail screens
   - Lever list screens
   - Lever detail screens
   - Tool detail screens
   (Basically all non-onboarding screens.)

3. Right-side Slide-In Drawer:
   - Implement a slide-in drawer that appears from the RIGHT when the hamburger icon is tapped.
   - The drawer must list the following menu items:

     - Home
     - Goals
     - My Plan
     - AI Tools
     - How It Works
     - Data & Privacy
     - Contact / Feedback
     - Terms & Conditions
     - Onboarding (restart)

   - When a menu item is tapped, navigate appropriately:
     - Home → scroll/route to top of Home.
     - Goals → Goals tab.
     - My Plan → My Plan tab.
     - AI Tools → AI Tools tab.
     - How It Works → scroll to "How It Works" section on Home or a dedicated screen.
     - Data & Privacy → open a new screen with placeholder content and a short explanation.
     - Contact / Feedback → open a new screen with:
       - short text
       - either a mailto link or a simple in-app feedback form (subject, message fields).
     - Terms & Conditions → open a simple scrollable screen with placeholder T&C text.
     - Onboarding → reset the onboarding flag in AsyncStorage and restart the onboarding wizard.

   - Keep styling consistent with the dark theme: rounded panel from the right, clear typography, proper spacing.

====================================================
2. LEVER LIST CARDS – COMPACT TWO-LINE DESIGN (VARIANT B)
====================================================

Goal:
Make lever cards easier to scan and compare for CFOs, focusing on Priority, Effort, and Impact.

Current:
Lever detail screens already show Priority, Effort, Impact, and other meta-data.
Lever list cards currently show effort and impact, with priority only in the details.

New design (Variant B):

1. Each lever list card (on the Goal detail / Strategic Levers screen) should have a compact, two-line core layout:

   - Line 1:
     - Left: circular badge with lever index (1, 2, 3, ...)
     - Right: lever title (e.g., "Automated Account Reconciliation")

   - Line 2:
     - Text layout like:
       `Priority: [High]   Effort: [Moderate]   Impact: [High]`
     - Each value in square brackets should be visually styled as a small pill/badge with color coding:
       - Priority: color based on level (e.g., red for High, orange for Medium, etc.)
       - Effort: e.g., yellow/orange scale.
       - Impact: e.g., green scale for Medium/High.
     - Ensure spacing so this line fits comfortably on one row on modern phones.

2. Optional small third line (only if space allows):
   - A micro text like: `• 2 AI tools recommended`
   - This should be subtle and not dominate the card.

3. The lever data model must now include a `priority` field if it doesn’t already:
   - `priority: 'High' | 'Medium' | 'Low'`

4. The lever list cards must read from a single source of truth so that:
   - Priority, Effort, Impact on the list and on the detail screen are always consistent.

====================================================
3. LEVER DETAIL SCREEN → AI TOOLS NAVIGATION
====================================================

Goal:
Make the recommended AI tools directly actionable from the lever detail screen.

Current:
At the bottom of the lever detail, there is a section “Recommended AI Tools” with chips and tool cards.

Changes:

1. For each recommended tool:
   - The chip (e.g., “MindBridge”, “HighRadius”) must be tappable.
   - Tapping a chip navigates to the AI Tool detail screen for that tool.
   - Also make the small tool cards in the lever detail list tappable → same navigation.

2. On the AI Tool detail screen, show:
   - Logo
   - Name
   - Category
   - Short description
   - Badges for related Goals (e.g., Speed, Quality, Automation, Compliance)
   - A "Open Website" button that uses `Linking.openURL(tool.url)`.

3. Ensure that lever → tool linking uses stable IDs:
   - Each lever stores a list of tool IDs (strings).
   - Each tool has a unique `id`.
   - The UI looks up the tool by ID from the central tools data store.

====================================================
4. CENTRALIZED TOOL DATA – EXTENDED TOOL INVENTORY
====================================================

Goal:
Introduce a single, centralized JSON/TypeScript data source containing all finance/AI tools and make it easy to link tools to goals and levers.

Implementation:

1. Create a new file `data/toolsData.ts` exporting an array `tools` of tool objects and a `Tool` TypeScript interface:

   ```ts
   export type GoalId = 'speed' | 'quality' | 'automation' | 'compliance';

   export interface Tool {
     id: string;
     name: string;
     category: string;
     shortDescription: string;
     url: string;
     logo?: any; // require('...') placeholder for now
     goalTags: GoalId[];        // which goals this tool supports
     keyFeatures: string[];     // AI/automation features, 2–5 bullet points
   }

   export const tools: Tool[] = [ /* see list below */ ];

2.	Populate tools with the following entries (you can keep logo as a placeholder or point to /assets/logos/<id>.png):
// NOTE FOR IMPLEMENTATION:
// For each of the tools below, fill goalTags based on where the tool adds most value (e.g., Speed, Quality, Automation, Compliance).
// Also fill keyFeatures as 2–5 short bullet points summarizing how the tool supports month-end close, automation, analytics, or control.
// You may use your own knowledge and/or internet search to refine these descriptions.

	3.	Make sure:
	•	The AI Tools list screen now reads exclusively from tools.
	•	Filters by Goal use goalTags.
	•	Tool detail screens use keyFeatures to show 2–5 bullet points like “Key features”.
	4.	Connect tools to levers and goals:
	•	Each lever object (in your levers data file) should get a toolIds: string[] field that references matching tool IDs from tools.
	•	Each goal should also have a recommendedToolIds: string[] field that lists top tools for that goal (for use in future goal-based recommendations).

====================================================
5. GLOBAL UX POLISH – SMALL BUT IMPORTANT IMPROVEMENTS

Please also implement the following UX refinements:
	1.	Headers & Logo:
	•	Make sure the logo is visible in the top header on all main and detail screens (again, excluding onboarding where you can keep the current wizard style).
	2.	Home Screen CTA coherence:
	•	The main hero CTA on Home should say “Get Started” if the user has not completed onboarding yet, and navigate into the onboarding wizard.
	•	If onboarding is already completed, show “View Goals” (or similar) and navigate to the Goals tab.
	•	Ensure the text used for CTAs is consistent across Home, end of onboarding, and the buttons that lead into the main experience.
	3.	My Plan:
	•	When a lever is added to the plan, avoid disruptive native alerts where possible.
	•	Instead, use a non-blocking toast/snackbar at the bottom: e.g., “Added to your plan”.
	•	On My Plan screen, group levers by goal and show the same compact Lever card layout (title + Priority/Effort/Impact row).
	4.	Performance & Clean Code:
	•	Use TypeScript types for Goal, Lever, and Tool entities.
	•	Avoid duplicating static data between screens; rely on central data/*.ts files.
	•	If some code is duplicated (e.g., lever cards used in different screens), refactor into reusable components.

====================================================
6. GITHUB & FILE ORGANIZATION (LIGHT TOUCH)
	1.	Add or update .gitignore for Expo/React Native (node_modules, .expo, dist, build, etc.).
	2.	Update README.md with:
	•	How to run the app (npm install, npx expo start).
	•	Mention that the project is connected to GitHub for version control.
	•	Brief explanation of the new data structure:
	•	data/goals.ts
	•	data/levers.ts
	•	data/toolsData.ts

====================================================
7. OUTPUT EXPECTATIONS

In your response, please:
	•	Show complete code for all new files:
	•	components/AppHeader.tsx
	•	navigation additions for the right-side drawer
	•	data/toolsData.ts (with all tools listed above)
	•	For existing components (Home, Goals, GoalDetail, LeverList, LeverDetail, AI Tools, My Plan):
	•	Show only the changed sections, but enough for me to paste them into my project without guessing imports.
	•	Ensure the app compiles and runs with the new header, drawer, lever card layout, AI tool links, and centralized tool data.

Remember:
	•	Do NOT remove existing functionality.
	•	Only extend and improve the current app so that it provides clearer value to CFOs and better navigation and tool linkage.
