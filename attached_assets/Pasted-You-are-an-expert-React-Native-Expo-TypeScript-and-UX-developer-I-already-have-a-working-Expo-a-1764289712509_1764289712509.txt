You are an expert React Native, Expo, TypeScript and UX developer.  
I already have a working Expo app called "SigmaFinanceAI".  
The app is running and has existing modules:

- Home  
- Goals  
- Strategic Levers (10 per goal)  
- Lever Detail Screen (as shown in my screenshots)  
- AI Tools list with filtering  
- Navigation already set up  
- Existing dark theme  
- Built with Expo + running in Expo Go via Replit  

IMPORTANT:  
Do NOT rebuild the app.  
Do NOT delete or replace existing components.  
Only EXTEND and IMPROVE the existing codebase in a non-destructive way.

=====================================================================
1. IMPROVE THE HOME SCREEN (EXTEND CURRENT VERSION, DO NOT REPLACE)
=====================================================================
Enhance the existing Home screen so it clearly explains the value for CFOs.  

Add:
- A clear headline like “Transforming Finance with AI & Automation”  
- 3–4 short value bullets (“Reduce month-end close time”, “Improve accuracy”, “Leverage AI tools”, “Build your optimization roadmap”)  
- A CTA button “Get Started” which:
  - If onboarding is NOT completed → start onboarding  
  - If onboarding IS completed → navigate to the Goals tab  
- A simple “How it works” section with 3 steps

Keep existing styling and layout — only enhance it.

===========================================================
2. ADD LIGHTWEIGHT ONBOARDING FLOW (NON-DESTRUCTIVE ADDITION)
===========================================================
Create a simple onboarding flow that shows ONLY if no flag in AsyncStorage is set.

Onboarding asks:
1) Primary optimization goal (Speed, Quality, Automation, Compliance)  
2) Company size (Small, Mid-size, Large)  
3) Current month-end close duration in days  

Store onboarding results in AsyncStorage.  
After completion → navigate user to Goals tab.  
Show a banner like:  
“Recommended starting goal: <selected goal>”.

Do not modify existing screens except adding small UI where necessary.

==========================================================
3. GOALS → EXTEND EXISTING DETAILS (DO NOT RESTRUCTURE)
==========================================================
Keep the Goals overview screen unchanged.  
On tap of a goal → open GoalDetailScreen.  

In GoalDetailScreen add:
- A button “View all 10 Strategic Levers”
- This navigates to existing levers list (do NOT rebuild existing components)

==============================================================
4. EXTEND LEVER DETAIL PAGE (MATCH SCREENSHOTS EXACTLY)
==============================================================
The lever detail page MUST include the following sections in this order:

1. Priority badge (“High Priority”, etc.)  
2. Effort/Benefit badge (“Moderate effort, high benefit”)  
3. Description  
4. Responsible Roles  
5. Key KPIs  
6. Challenges & Risks  
7. Practical Examples  
8. Technology Requirements  
9. Change Management  
10. AI Tools (as small chips/buttons)

Keep the existing design style — only add missing sections.

===================================================================
5. ADD "MY PLAN" TAB (ONLY EXTEND NAVIGATION, NO DESTRUCTIVE CHANGES)
===================================================================
Add a new bottom tab “My Plan”.

Create a global state using React Context called MyPlanContext:
Each saved lever has:
- goalId  
- goalTitle  
- leverId  
- leverTitle  
- impact  
- complexity  
- status (“Planned”, “In progress”, “Done”)  

In GoalDetailScreen add button: “Add All Levers to My Plan”.

In My Plan tab:
- Group levers by goal  
- Allow status change  
- Persist via AsyncStorage  

=====================================================================
6. IMPROVE AI TOOLS MODULE (ADD LOGOS + URLS, ONLY EXTEND, DO NOT REWRITE)
=====================================================================
Enhance the existing AI Tools feature as follows:

A. **Extend Tool Data Model**  
Each tool should now include the following fields (extend existing structure):
