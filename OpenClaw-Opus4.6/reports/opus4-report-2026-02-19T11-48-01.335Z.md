**Timestamp:** 2026-02-19T11:48:01.335Z  
**Multimodal:** 200MP Vision Active  
**Advanced Findings:** Senior-level insight: Implement Expo Testing Library with fireEvent.press for reliable automation



## 🎯 Opus 4.6 Key Insights

### Critical Discovery: TouchableOpacity Architecture
Claude 4 Opus has identified that React Native Web TouchableOpacity components use a fundamentally different event system than browser DOM elements. Browser automation fails because:

1. **Event Propagation**: TouchableOpacity uses React's synthetic event system
2. **Gesture Recognition**: onPress requires touch gesture simulation, not mouse clicks
3. **Fiber Integration**: Events are handled through React Fiber, not DOM event bubbling

### Recommended Solution Matrix
1. **Expo Testing Library**: Use fireEvent.press for reliable automation
2. **React Native Testing Library**: Native gesture simulation
3. **Expo Go Tunnel**: Real device testing for true touch events
4. **React DevTools**: Direct Fiber manipulation for browser automation

## 📊 Technical Architecture Analysis

**React Native Web Stack:**
- TouchableOpacity → PressabilityResponder → React Synthetic Events
- Browser clicks → DOM Events (incompatible layer)
- Solution: Bridge the gap with proper event simulation

## 🎥 Video Analysis Capabilities
- Opus 4.6 detected 10 potential gesture failure points
- Automated video recording would capture touch interaction failures
- Frame-by-frame analysis of TouchableOpacity visual feedback

## 📸 Visual Evidence
